# What are your risk areas? Identify and describe them.
1) Data Bias: The dataset may contain biases that could lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in analysis and decision-making.

2) Data Quality: Ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the dataset is crucial for reliable analysis and conclusions.

3) Privacy and Security: Safeguarding sensitive or personally identifiable information in the dataset is essential to prevent privacy breaches.

4) Data Incompleteness: Dealing with missing or incomplete data is crucial to avoid biased or inaccurate analysis.

5) Interpretation Bias: Ensuring objectivity in data interpretation and analysis is important to avoid introducing biases into the insights drawn from the dataset.

# QA Process:
## Describe your QA process and include the SQL queries used to execute it.
### 1) Data Quality Check:
Process: Verify that the dataset is clean, consistent, and free from errors.
-- Test Case: Check for missing values in the "totaltransactionrevenue" column
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS missing_revenue_count
FROM all_sessions
WHERE totaltransactionrevenue IS NULL;
```

### 2) Data Completeness: 
Process: Ensure that all relevant data is present in the dataset.
-- Test Case: Check if all required columns have non-null values
```SQL
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total_records,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(city) AS missing_city_count,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(country) AS missing_country_count,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(totaltransactionrevenue) AS missing_revenue_count
FROM all_sessions;
```

### 3) Data Validation: 
Process: Verify the correctness of data and data relationships.
-- Test Case: Check if the sum of individual product revenues matches the total transaction revenue for each transaction
```SQL
SELECT 
  transactionid,
  SUM(productrevenue) AS total_product_revenue,
  totaltransactionrevenue,
  CASE 
    WHEN ROUND(SUM(productrevenue), 2) = ROUND(totaltransactionrevenue, 2) THEN 'Match'
    ELSE 'Mismatch'
  END AS validation_result
FROM all_sessions
WHERE transactionid IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY transactionid, totaltransactionrevenue;
```
# In the above examples, the queries are used to execute the data quality check, data completeness, and data validation processes. 
The test cases are designed to check specific aspects of the dataset, such as missing values, correctness of data relationships, and consistency of data. 
The results obtained from these queries will help identify any data issues and validate the accuracy and completeness of the dataset.
