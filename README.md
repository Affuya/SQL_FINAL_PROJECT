# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL
----------------------------------------------------------

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
Description:
The dataset contains information related to website sessions and product sales. 
It includes data from various tables, such as "all_sessions," "analytics," "products," "sales_by_sku," and "sales_report." 
The "all_sessions" table provides details about website sessions, including visitor information (fullvisitorid), channel grouping, session duration (timeonsite), 
total transaction revenue, country, city, and various other session-related metrics. 
The "analytics" table contains visitor analytics data, such as visit number, revenue, page views, and time spent on the site. 
The "products" table holds information about products, including stock level, sentiment scores, and product names. 
The "sales_by_sku" and "sales_report" tables contain data related to product sales, including total ordered quantities and revenue.

Goals:
1. Analyze Revenue Generation: The primary goal is to understand the revenue generated from each city and country. 
This involves calculating total transaction revenue for each city/country combination and identifying regions that contribute the most to overall revenue.

2. Product Sales Patterns: Investigate the patterns of products sold to identify top-selling products, 
their popularity in different regions, and their correlation with revenue. 
Analyzing product sales patterns can provide insights into customer preferences and help optimize product offerings.

3. Visitor Behavior Analysis: Study visitor behavior metrics, such as session duration, page views, and search keywords, to understand how visitors interact with the website. 
This analysis can help optimize website design and content to enhance user experience and engagement.

4. Geographic Analysis: Explore the geographic distribution of visitors and customers to identify regions with high demand for products. 
This information can inform marketing and sales strategies, targeting specific areas with tailored campaigns.

5. Product Sentiment Analysis: Assess sentiment scores and magnitude associated with products to understand customer sentiment towards different products. 
This analysis can help identify products with positive or negative sentiment and address potential issues.

By achieving these goals, the analysis will provide valuable insights into revenue generation, product sales patterns, 
visitor behavior, and geographic trends, enabling data-driven decision-making to improve business performance and customer satisfaction.

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

-- STEP 1: Created all_sessions_excel table directly from pgadmin -- STEP 2: Created products-excel table using code below

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products( SKU VARCHAR(50), name VARCHAR(300), orderedQuantity INT DEFAULT 0, stockLevel INT DEFAULT 0, 
restockingLeadTime INT DEFAULT 0, sentimentScore FLOAT, sentimentMagnitude FLOAT);

-- STEP 3: Creating sales_by_sku_excel table with code below CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales_by_sku( productSKU VARCHAR(100), 
total_ordered INT DEFAULT 0);

-- STEP 4: Creating analytics-excel table using below code CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "analytics"( visitNumber INT DEFAULT 0, 
visitId INT PRIMARY KEY, visitStartTime TIME, date DATE, fullvisitorId INT DEFAULT 0, userid INT, channelGrouping VARCHAR(300), 
socialEngagementType VARCHAR(300), units_sold INT DEFAULT 0, pageviews INT DEFAULT 0, timeonsite TIMESTAMP, bounces INT DEFAULT 0, revenue INT DEFAULT 0, unit_price INT DEFAULT 0);

-- STEP 5 Creating sales_report-excel table using below code CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "sales_report"( productSKU VARCHAR(50), 
total_ordered INT DEFAULT 0, name VARCHAR(100), stockLevel INT DEFAULT 0, restockingLeadTime INT DEFAULT 0, sentimentScore FLOAT, sentimentMagnitude FLOAT, ratio FLOAT);
## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

Missing Data: Dealing with missing values in the dataset was challenging, as it may affect the accuracy of calculations and analysis. 
Deciding on the appropriate approach to handle missing data, such as imputation or excluding records, was challenging.

Data Quality and Integrity: Ensuring data quality and integrity was critical for reliable analysis. Data inconsistencies, errors, or duplicates might exist in the dataset, 
which could lead to incorrect conclusions if not addressed properly.

Data Transformation: Combining data from multiple tables and aligning them for analysis required complex data transformation steps. 
Handling data type conversions, date formats, and ensuring compatibility between tables was time-consuming and required attention to detail.

Joining Tables: Linking data from multiple tables correctly can be complex, especially when not sure of the correct primary keys and foreign keys. 
Ensuring the right joins and understanding the relationships between tables was essential for accurate analysis.

Data Privacy and Security: If the dataset contained sensitive information, ensuring data privacy and adhering to data protection regulations becomes crucial.

Data Interpretation: Analyzing the data required domain knowledge and expertise to interpret the results correctly. 
I was not sure my understanding of the context and domain-specific nuances gave was enough to draw meaningful insights from the data.

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
Data Enrichment: Consider integrating external data sources to enrich the existing dataset. This could involve adding demographic data, 
economic indicators, or weather information, depending on the analysis goals. Enriching the dataset can provide additional context and lead to more comprehensive insights.

Customer Segmentation: Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques to group visitors based on their behaviors and characteristics. 
Understanding different customer segments can help tailor marketing strategies and improve customer experience.

Predictive Modeling: Build predictive models to forecast future revenue, product demand, or visitor behavior. 
Machine learning algorithms like regression or time series forecasting can be applied to uncover predictive patterns in the data.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) Analysis: If the dataset contains textual data, apply NLP techniques to extract insights from unstructured text. 
Sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and keyword extraction can provide valuable information about customer feedback and preferences.
